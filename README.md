# ForceField
					  
by [Omer Shapira](http://omershapira.com) and [Ohad Ron](http://ohadron.com/)

ForceField is a Kinect-Controlled, wall-sized sequencer and musical instrument. It works with a transparent screen (so people can see what you're playing) and a projector (so it fits in the middle of the room!), and can be used on stage(!), while holding other instruments(!!). 

Heres a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QUXCOKZOpc) of what it looks like:

Forcefield is still under development. You're welcome to help.
